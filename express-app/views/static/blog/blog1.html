            <p>Posted: Feb 15th, 2026</p>

            <p>
                From the far distant lands of the <strong>internet</strong>, you have made a landing here at Bytesized Journal. I am honored to have you visit this site during your travels. The destination you have landed upon is a personal project to answer the question of "can I develop my own journaling app." The indie web has fascinated me for quite a while. Maybe about three years, I had been building small websites as hobbiest projects while adding more interactivity with each one I developed. In that same period of time, I had also been using a note taking app for my daily journaling that I was not satisfied with largely due to it being cloud based and I could not access my own information without an internet connection. Even worse, if there is a service outage, I may lose my own information indefinitely.
            </p>

            <h2>Bytesized Journal Enters the Picture</h2>

            <p>
                This is where Bytesized Journal comes in. I decided to combine my knowledge of making indie websites along with making a replacement to my current note taking app for journaling and came up with the idea that became this site you have landed upon.
            </p>

            <p>
                My goals were the following:
            </p>

            <ul>

                <li>Have a dedicated journaling app that could be used without an internet connection</li>

                <li>The app can be accessed from any device without knowledge of particular platforms</li>
            
                <li>The app can be easily shared with other people</li>

            </ul>

            <p>
                The solution I came up with was to make the journaling app be a website that stores journal entries on the device of the person that created them. This allows the entries to be accessed without an internet connection. This also has the added benefit that I do not need to set up a complex database system for storing user data on my web server when I don't have anything to store to begin with. If in the unfortunate event that the website were to be hacked, there would be no data to be leaked. To that end, the user may not need to make requests to my server after they begin using the app but I will get into that topic in a little bit. The number of entries the person can create depends on how much storage their device has, giving them the most freedom. Because the app is a website at its core, the app can be accessed from any device with a web browser. There is no need to get approval from a particular app store. I can simply host the website like any of the others I have created. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Though I created the app for my own journaling, I do want to share it with anyone else that is interested in the same ideas. 
            </p>

            <h2>What is Currently in the App?</h2>

            <p>
                When you first open the app, you are greeted with a dashboard that can display any existing journal entries with the most recent at the top. You can click a button to create a new entry and start writing about your day right away. Or you can open the calendar page which will show the entries on the day they were created. Displaying a journal entry on a calendar was the hardest part of the app to create but I found great satisfaction in visually conveying time in relation to the entries. One of the features of the app is that dream journal entries can be created and are in their own list of journal entries. I can use the calendar to display how many days in a row I had a dream for instance. 
            </p>

            <h2>What the Future Holds for the App</h2>

            <p>
                In the next couple of months, I want to add some new features such as the ability to save images to a journal entry. I would also like to display internet media such as a frame for videos or images in a journal entry. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Another goal is to have the app be installable from the web browser directly and available entirely offline. If I chose to install the app on my phone, I want it to run entirely on my phone, no mobile data usage at all. 
            </p>

            <p>
                If you feel inclined to try out the app, I encourage you to give it a test run and give me any feedback on what you thought about it. 
            </p>
